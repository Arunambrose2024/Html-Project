        <h2>padding</h2>
        <p>Padding is the space between the content and the border of an element. Padding is valuable in making additional space inside an element, keeping it at a set distance from other aspects of a website. Using padding is extremely beneficial when you need to separate text boxes and images while also keeping them aligned.
